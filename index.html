					<h2>Globalization and Invasive species</h2>

					Invasive species are detailed as non-native species that account for ecological or economic damage in their introduced range. These species can have a range of negative impact on native landscape, biodiversity, forestry, agriculture, and human health. Historically, humans have furthered the introduction and transmission of non-native species through trade and transportation. In the last 50 years, we have observed an development in the range and diversity of these biological invasions, a phenomena of globalization. There are two key factors in this globalization process. First, the income growth. Data has shown a clear association between the Gross Domestic Product and the abundance of alien floras & faunas, around the world. In most cases, the introduction of trade has played a significant part in the presence of biological invasions. Secondly, the technological and logistical improvements, after the second world war, have accelerated the speed of transporting commodities and other unintended matters around the globe. The international trade links of sea, land, and air have brought a new pathway for alien species. Data shows that invasive species move at the speed of commerce.1
